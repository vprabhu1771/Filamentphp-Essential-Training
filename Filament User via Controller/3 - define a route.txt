Next, define a route in your routes/web.php file:

use App\Http\Controllers\FilamentUserController;

Route::get('/create-filament-user', [FilamentUserController::class, 'createAdminUser']);


Now, when you access the route /create-filament-user in your browser, it will trigger the createAdminUser method in the FilamentUserController, 
and it will execute the Artisan command to create the Filament user.

Make sure to set a strong password in the controller method before deploying it to production. Also, 
consider adding appropriate validation and error handling based on your application's requirements.
